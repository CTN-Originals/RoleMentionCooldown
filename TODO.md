# Features
## Configs
- [x] Admin role, a role that can manage the configurations of this bot
- [ ] Option to only apply the mentionable cooldown in specific channels
- [ ] Option to only permit surtain roles to use the mentionable
- [ ] Option to keep track of a cooldown per channel, if mention is used in channel x, it will still be able to be used in channel y, but both x and y will have their own cooldown tracker
- [ ] 2 options to allow a mentionable to be mentioned in x time range a maximum of y amount of times

## Commands
- [x] When a role is added, check if that role is above the bots role, and if so, tell the user this is impossible
- [x] /list command to list all mention cooldowns with their current cooldown time raped in a relative timestamp
	- [ ] Add paging functionality into the lists as there is a chance a server might add so many roles that it will overflow the embed limits
- [x] for /rolecooldown add: check if the user entered a number without any letters after it, and if so,
	- [x] if it is just one number, turn it into seconds
	- [x] if its multiple numbers seperated by spaces, notify the user of the correct usage
- [x] /help
- [ ] /faq
- [ ] /support: will send a link to the bots discord server
- [ ] /toggle , if set to false, it wont check if any mentionables are mentioned in messages
- [ ] Toggle all mentionables mention permission, if false, all mentionables cant be used nomatter the cooldown untill turned off again
- [ ] /help: only show the commands the interactor is allowed to use with their permissions

## Other
- [x] Tunr on/off the mentionable permission for any role for members depending on its cooldown
- [ ] Think of a way to limit the mentionable usage to sertain channels while still keeping the mentionable role permission checked
	- a work around might be to have a config option where the bot will warn people if they use it outside the target channel and then also have a config option for the warning message. then add another config option ontop of that to have the bot time these people out once it happens with another config option for the timeout duration.
		- another thing to add on top of this would be a strike system where a person can mistakenly do this x(config) amount of times before getting timed out for y(config) amount of time
	- another (less scalable) way would be to have the bot manage automod rules and add some roles in some rulesets, but this would be bad as the automod rules are limited and only allows 8 or so variations where some of those will likely already be taken by the server


# Technical
- [x] add an OnGuildCreate event for when the bot enters a guild
- [x] have this event als create all relevant documents in the database so that a document should never not exist
- [x] also listen for if the bot leaves a guild
- [x] either delete the documents of this guild, or give it a delay time to delete these documents
- [x] once a role cooldown is removed, turn off its permission for safety
- [x] On startup, interate through all servers, and all mentionables to check if any cooldown might have expired while it was down, and start the callbacks for all that are still on cooldown
- [x] Make an alternate system for cooldown tracking instead of setting a timeout for each cooldown as setTimeout might have unforseen performance impects.
- [ ] Find a better way to maintain database document function like mentionables.ts or guildConfig.ts
- [ ] Rewrite registerCommands with more of a typescript mindset... i was sush a noob back when i wrote that script :/
- [ ] Check if the bot is missing any permissions, and if so, alert the user once a command is used that needs those permissions

# Potential edge cases
- [ ] Getting rate limeted for flipping the "everyone can mention this role" permission? 

# Prep for public
## Bot
- [x] Figure out exactly which guild permissions the bot needs to function
- [x] Test how the bot works while being on multiple servers
- [x] Make a good landiing page for the bots documentation

## Code
- [ ] Update [`better-console-utilities`](https://github.com/CTN-Originals/Better-Console-Utilities) so that the actual module code includes key filtering and not just the local version in this project.
- [ ] add a contribution guideline document to the github
- [ ] Create a .env-example file
